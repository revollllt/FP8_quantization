## How to install
Make sure to have Python â‰¥3.8 (tested with Python 3.8.10) and 
ensure the latest version of `pip` (tested with 21.3.1):
```bash
conda create -n fp8_python=3.9
conda activate fp8_python
```

Next, install PyTorch 2.4.0 with the appropriate CUDA version (tested with CUDA 11.8):
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Finally, install the remaining dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running experiments
```bash
sh scripts/image_net.sh
